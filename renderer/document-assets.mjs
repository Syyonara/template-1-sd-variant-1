 * heading spaced in the component editor silently lost that spacing on every page
 * that placed it.
 *
 * Expansion has to happen before compilation rather than after. A repeating node's
 * copies are given suffixed ids — `slide` becomes `slide-1`, `slide-2` — and the
 * selector is an exact id match, so styles compiled from the unexpanded tree would
 * name nodes that are not in the output.

 * @param ctx Needs `sections`, the same map `renderDocument` expands against.
